## BTI425 Week 8 Notes

> Friday, February 21 - classroom lecture  
> Then the study week break  
> Tuesday, March 3 - Test 2 in the computer-lab 

This week, we cover the Angular routing topic. Similar to what you learned in the React topic coverage, routing enables navigation among components in an app.

<br>

### Friday plan

*Friday, February 21*  

In a recent computer-lab class, the professor [introduced *simple* routing](angular-routing-intro) for an Angular app. We return to this topic today. 

[Routing and URL parameters](https://bti425.ca/notes/week07-in-class#implement-the-get-one-use-case) - this brief section explains the implementation technique.   

Read the [official Angular.io documentation](https://angular.io/docs) for these topics:
* [Routing & Navigation](https://angular.io/guide/router)
* [RouterOutlet](https://angular.io/api/router/RouterOutlet)
* [RouterLink](https://angular.io/api/router/RouterLink)

Remember to frequently use the [learning resources](/resources).

### Tuesday plan

*Tuesday, March 3 (after study week)* 

Test 2 is on Tuesday, March 3, 2020, and approximately 70 to 80 minutes have been alotted for the test. At the beginning of the class time, the professor will be available to answer questions about course content, and then we will begin the test. 

You can expect test questions about topics covered since the last test, all the way to this week's topics. Obviously, you must review the topics yourself, but in general, you can expect questions about:
* React and working with a web API
* React and forms 
* React deployment 
* Angular platform overview
* Angular components
* Angular routing 
* Angular simple service, and working with a web API (a *very* light touch, based on the [Week 7 in-class exercise](week07-in-class))

[This document](test-success-info) has more information about the test.

There are three sections of the BTI425 course. All sections have Test 2 on the same day. The test will be different for each section. You are *EXPECTED* to behave with academic integrity - *DO NOT* communicate, in any way, with another BTI425 student about the content of the test.
