### Friday plan

*Friday, January 17* 

A reminder - new topic presentation, discussions, and demonstrations. While some brief notes are included below, be prepared to [take your own notes](/bti425/standards#taking-notes-in-class-and-before-class-as-you-prepare). 

This week, we introduce a new way (for our students) to think about building an web app: [Component-based architecture](component-idea). 

To get started, read this [introduction to React](react-intro), and also follow its links to read or skim additional content. 

Next, follow along as you [get started with React](react-get-started). Learn how to generate a starter app. Then, start learning about its component-based architecture. Follow the tutorials. 

Then, we repeat or highlight some of [the important topics and concepts](react-architecture) from the getting started guide and tutorials.

### Code examples

The course's GitHub repo has code examples for many topics and techniques. You can download a zip of the code repo, or clone it.

### Tuesday plan

*Tuesday, January 21* 

It is possible that leftover topic highlights will be presented at the beginning of the session. Next, the professor will guide you to get started with the week's new dev tools. Then, there will be time to work on the programming assignment task.
