## BTI425 Week 9 Notes

> Friday, March 6 - classroom lecture  
> Tuesday, March 10 - hands-on in the computer-lab 

This week, we plan to cover some more "services" topics, and introduce "forms" topics. We also plan to discuss *debugging* for Angular apps. 

<br>

### Friday plan

*Friday, March 6* 

Highlights from this week's topics: 

A couple of weeks ago, we had a brief and gentle introduction to an Angular service as part of a Week 7 in-class coding exercise. To supplement that introduction, here is a [formal introduction to an Angular service](/bti425/notes/angular-services-intro). 

Today, we add more coverage of this important topic: 

[More Angular service coverage](angular-services-more) - Adds on to the introductory content.

[Angular service example](angular-services-example) - A supporting code example, posted in the repo.

And then...

[Data assocations or relations introduction](data-assoc-intro) - Helps you get started with this topic.

In the computer-lab class...

[Angular Debugging Introduction](angular-debug-intro) - A brief introduction to debugging in Angular. 

[Angular template-driven forms introduction](angular-forms-intro) - The highlights of how to get started with forms in Angular. (Forms will be more fully covered next week.) 

Remember to frequently use the [learning resources](/bti425/resources).
