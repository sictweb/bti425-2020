> Tuesday, March 24 - real-time help from the professor 

This week, we will make progress with *forms* topics.  

<br>

### Friday plan

*Friday, March 13* 

Highlights from this week's topics: 

Recently, we were introduced to [Angular template-driven forms](angular-forms-intro). It's time to learn more. 

> Remember our previous coverage of  
> [HTML Form patterns](html-form-patterns). 

For best results, a form requires a data model. This document discusses the concept and development technique:  
[Angular Forms Data Models](angular-forms-data)

Then, we'll learn some techniques to improve the interaction experience users have with forms. And, we'll introduce data validation techniques. These topics are covered in this document:  
[Introduction to Angular template-driven forms validation](angular-forms-validation-intro)

The course's GitHub repo has a nice code example that covers the typical CRUD tasks, and another covers validation essentials. 

Remember to frequently use the [learning resources](/resources).
