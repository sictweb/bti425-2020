## BTI425 Week 1 Notes

The theme for the first week or more is to transition your success in the previous course to the new topics in this course.

Remember to frequently use the [learning resources](/bti425/resources).

<br>

**Previous course**

In the previous course (BTI325), you began to learn the principles and practices for creating simple web apps and services:
* Most of the work was done on the server (generation, computation, etc.)
* Resources were dynamically and generated on demand, and delivered to browsers (and yes, we could still deliver static assets, like images)
* Very little work was done with the browser DOM

In this course, you will enhance your web API knowledge and application, and add front end development principles and practices to your skillset. This will enable a modern, widely-used, and truly distributed computing environment. 

In the previous course, you had a taste of this with the Ajax coverage. That enabled a small amount of interaction in a browser, typically to replace or refresh an area of the visible document. 

<br>

**This course**

We'll build on the previous course's Ajax coverage with a *thorough survey* of front end development techniques and approaches, by covering a few widely-used libraries and frameworks. The destination will be a *thorough introduction* to a feature-rich application platform, Angular. 

The first part of this course will ensure that you have your server-side development environment configured correctly. We will design, program, and then install and configure a data-rich project on the server, which will persist resources that can be used by some of the front end apps that we create during the course. A natural result will be that you will learn more about, and write code for, a web service (also known as a web API). In summary, you'll transition from writing server code that generates and delivers HTML, to server code that generates and delivers resources that are formatted as JSON. 

The weekly notes will be organized and delivered as a collection of topic-themed documents. This page - "week01" - will simply guide you throught the topics in sequence. (Read [more about this organization scheme here](/notes/about).)

<br>

**Topics**

This week's topics include: 

[Welcome](/notes/welcome) to the BTI425 course

[Web services (re)introduction](/notes/intro-web-services)

[Creating a web service](/notes/web-api-v1)

<br>

**Reminder**

We expect the student to do their work on a computer that runs macOS (Mac OS X), Linux, or another Unix-like operating system. 

If a student has a Windows 10 computer, then plan to install an environment that enables the installation of Linux.
