## BTI425 Week 1 Notes

> Tuesday, January 7 - hands-on in the computer-lab

The theme for the first few classes is to transition your success in the previous course to the new topics in this course.

Remember to frequently use the [learning resources](/bti425-2020/resources).

<br>

### Previous course

In the previous course (BTI325), you began to learn the principles and practices for creating simple web apps and services:
* Most of the work was done on the server (document generation, computation, etc.)
* Resources were dynamically generated on demand, and delivered to browsers (and yes, we could still deliver static assets, like images)
* Very little work was done with the browser DOM

In this course, you will enhance your web service knowledge and its implementation, and add front end development principles and practices to your skillset. This will enable a modern, widely-used, and truly distributed computing environment. 

In the previous course, you had a taste of this with the Ajax coverage. That enabled a small amount of interaction in a browser, typically to replace or refresh an area of the visible document. 

<br>

### This course

We'll build on the previous course's Ajax coverage with a survey of front end development techniques and approaches, by covering a few widely-used libraries and frameworks, and then spending a few weeks with React. The destination will be a *thorough introduction* to a feature-rich application platform, Angular. 

The first part of this course will ensure that you have your server-side development and deployment (hosting) environment configured correctly. We will design, program, and then install and configure one or more data-rich project on the server, which will persist resources that can be used by some of the front end apps that we create during the course. A natural result will be that you will learn more about, and write code for, a web service (also known as a web API). In summary, you'll transition from writing server code that generates and delivers HTML, to server code that generates and delivers resources that are formatted as JSON. 

The weekly notes will be organized and delivered as a collection of topic-themed documents. This page - "week01" - will simply guide you throught the topics in sequence. (Read [more about this organization scheme here](/bti425-2020/notes/about).)

### Tuesday plan

*Tuesday, January 7*

New topic presentation, discussions, and demonstrations. While some brief notes are included below, be prepared to [take your own notes](/bti425-2020/standards#taking-notes-in-class-and-before-class-as-you-prepare). 

* [Welcome](/bti425-2020/notes/welcome) to the BTI425 course

* [Developer tools](dev-tools) used in this course

* [Web services (re)introduction](/bti425-2020/notes/intro-web-services)

* [Creating a web service](/bti425-2020/notes/web-api-v1)

* [This document](/bti425-2020/notes/postman-intro) introduces you to Postman, and has how-to getting started info.

<br>

### Code examples

The course's GitHub repo has code examples for many topics and techniques. You can download a zip of the code repo, or clone it. 
* Web API v4 - essential interaction
* Web API v5 - data is an array of strings
* Web API v6 - data model manager and an array of objects 

<br>

### Reminder

We expect the student to do their work on a computer that runs macOS (Mac OS X), Linux, or another Unix-like operating system. 

If a student has a Windows 10 computer, then plan to install an environment that enables the installation of Linux. We recommend Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and Ubuntu version 18.04 from the Microsoft Store.
