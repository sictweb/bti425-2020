## BTI425 Week 2 Notes

> Friday, January 10 - classroom lecture  
> Tuesday, January 14 - hands-on in the computer-lab 

This week, we continue our two-week re-introduction to web services. We will work with a database, and then deploy a web service and its database to a public host. 

Then, a small number of JavaScript-based client apps will be created, to interact with the web service. Although we will briefly discuss the original XmlHttpRequest object and the jQuery library, we'll prefer to use the new-ish Fetch API. 

The Moment library - which helps with date handling - will also be introduced. 

Remember to frequently use the [learning resources](/bti425/resources).

New topic presentation, discussions, and demonstrations. While some brief notes are included below, be prepared to [take your own notes](/bti425/standards#taking-notes-in-class-and-before-class-as-you-prepare). 

* [Creating a hosted web service with a database](/bti425/notes/web-api-v2)

* [Simple apps that interact with a web API](/bti425/notes/web-api-client-apps) 

* Handling Date/Time information using [Moment.js](moment)

During the breaks, please get up and move around. It's important for your health, and for mental performance.

### Reminder

We expect the student to do their work on a computer that runs macOS (Mac OS X), Linux, or another Unix-like operating system. 

If a student has a Windows 10 computer, then plan to install an environment that enables the installation of Linux. We recommend Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and Ubuntu version 18.04 from the Microsoft Store.
