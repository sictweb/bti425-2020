## BTI425 Week 2 Notes

This week, we continue our two-week re-introduction to web services. We will work with a database, and then deploy a web service and its database to a public host. 

Then, a small number of JavaScript-based client apps will be created, to interact with the web service. The plan is to create these apps:
* Using XmlHttpRequest 
* Using jQuery
* Using the new Fetch API

The Moment library - which helps with date handling - will also be introduced.
