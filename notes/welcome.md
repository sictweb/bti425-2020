## Welcome to the BTI425 course

Welcome to the BTI425 course. This document has information that helps you get started in the course.

<br>

### Course introduction

Welcome to BTI425!

In this course, you will learn to create web client (front end, in the browser) apps that work with a web service (back end, in the server). The apps will enable entry-level functionality, which can be hosted on-premise or in the cloud.

Throughout the learning process, you will learn foundational concepts, skills, and technologies that will enable you to create high-quality intermediate- and advanced-level web applications in the future. These foundations will include:
* More JavaScript
* Web API (web services) on a modern server stack (Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB)
* The concept (and application) of front end web client development
* A survey of widely-used current/existing front end development environments
* The Angular application platform

Coming into the course, you must have some experience and success programming object-oriented software in C++. This means that you must have passed BTP200.

In addition, you must have some experience and success with web client programming, and you must "get" the server-based web application concept. This means that you must have passed BTI225 and BTI325.

We're also counting on database experience and success gained in your database courses, and in BTI325.

In summary, we are counting on you having some experience and success in the following foundational concepts, skills, and technologies BEFORE starting this course:
* Object-oriented software development using C++
* HTML5 programming (JavaScript, the DOM, HTML, and CSS)
* Database concepts (schema, data definition, data manipulation)
* Unix or Linux operating system experience, so you can install, configure, and use new software

In addition to the above list, you need the ability to learn quickly and effectively. You will be expected to learn (through watching, listening, reading, doing, and helping others) a significant amount of material. This learning will be done incrementally, so you must keep involved during the course to be successful.

### How can you get started?

Get familiar with the course web site. All areas.  

**Using your own personal computer**

We expect the student to do their work on a computer that runs macOS (formerly known as Mac OS X), Linux, or another Unix-like operating system. If a student has a Windows 10 computer, then plan to install an environment that enables the installation of Linux. Alternatively, configure a dual-boot scenario.

> Important - We *expect* you to do your work on macOS, Linux, or another Unix-like operating system. 

The student will use a number of applications and development tools, including:
* A modern web app execution environment (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB)
* Visual Studio Code
* The Angular platform
* Various code generators 

During the course, the professor(s) will guide the student in the installation, configuration, and use of the software. 

> Please be aware of the following:
> 
> You are NOT required to use your own personal computer for BTI425 course work.
> 
> The College has hundreds of correctly-configured systems, ready to be used. You can save your work in the cloud, or on a (fast) USB flash drive.
> 
> If you have problems or difficulties using your own personal computer for BTI425 course work, your professor will not be able to provide technical support. Maybe the student help desk (in the library) can help. In a problem scenario, you are still expected to complete your work on time. A problematic personal computer *cannot* be used as an excuse for delays in completing the course work.

### How to use these course notes

Every class/session will have notes posted on this web site.

All notes will be linked from the [notes index page](/notes/). 

Study that page's URI to learn the naming convention for a specific weekly notes page.

Your professor(s) plan to post the notes at least two days before the class/session begins. Before you come into a class, you are expected to read and process the topics covered in the notes.

The format and style of the notes pages will vary. At times, they will be terse, with headings and keywords that are intended to guide the student through the topics. At other times, they will be lengthy, with narrative that explains and supports the topics. Expect a full range of formats and styles between these extremes.

Class/sessions are important. This is not a distance education (online) course. The notes do not attempt to capture everything that must be communicated in the process of learning a topic.

<br> 

### What do we expect from you?

Before the Friday class (in the classroom), we expect you to prepare. This means:
* Read and study the class notes page
* Read and study the linked documents
* Read and study the code examples, and then run them on a device (yours or one at the College), and then attempt to re-create all or part of each code example 
* Make your own notes, including questions that you have

In other words, do not come into the classroom expecting somehow to learn, by listening only, that week's topics. You need to prepare before class, so that you understand the topics and their context. 

In the Tuesday class (in the computer-lab), we expect you to be an engaged and actively-learning participant. This means:
* Listening effectively
* Asking and answering questions
* Writing notes
* Doing the in-class exercises and activities

Before the Tuesday class/session of the week, we also expect you to prepare for the class. This means:
* Being prepared to split your time between new topic learning, and working hands-on with the topic or the current assignment
* Asking and answering questions
* Writing notes
* Read and study the current assignment
* Practice its contents, and/or get started on its contents

Regarding the workload, it will simply not be possible to confine this course's learning experience to the scheduled four periods per week. We expect you to spend some of the Tuesday in-class time working on the assignments, but you must spend time out-of-class to complete the work.

That being said, you will encounter problems and delays. Please follow a general rule: If you cannot solve the problem within 20 to 30 minutes, then stop and set it aside. Seek help from your professor, during class time, or during the designated help time or office hours. Alternatively, seek help from a classmate *who knows the solution* to the problem. 

Do not waste time. Do not attempt to wrestle the problem to the ground. Others will not think any less of you when you ask for help. You're here to learn, so take advantage of the course's resources and delivery to help you learn.
