## Web API design, create, deploy, and test, version 1

The theme of this document is to design and create a simple web service. 

The web service will deliver data to requestors. The data will be materialized in the app (i.e. as JavaScript objects). A future "version 2" web service will use a database. 

<br>

### Confirm that your tooling is ready

Before writing and running the app, confirm that your computer's tooling is ready. The College systems should be ready, but you may have to do some of these tasks if you want to use your own computer. 

> Remember the cautions in the [welcome document](welcome#how-can-you-get-started):  
> We expect you to use a Unix-like system to do your work.  
> The College has hundreds of correctly-configured systems that are ready for use, so don't waste course time doing personal configuration tasks (do that on your own time).  

<br>

#### If your system does not yet have the Node.js app dev ecosystem

Install Node.js (which also installs npm). Verify its status:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

<br>

#### If your system does not have the developer tools

1. Install git
2. Install GitHub Desktop
3. Install more browsers (assume that Safari is already there; add Chrome, Firefox, and Opera)
4. Install Visual Studio Code (aka VS Code)

<br>

#### Configure VS Code

Do this only if it was just or recently installed: Configure "`code .`" functionality [as described here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac).

<br>

### Create a project to hold the web service

Using Terminal, navigate to the file system location that will hold the project. Create a new folder to hold the project. 

Navigate into that folder. Create an empty `server.js` file. Create an empty `index.html` file. It's also a good idea to create an empty `README.md` file.

Now, initialize the folder as a Node.js app:

```bash
npm init
```

Make sure you specify `server.js` as its entry point. Add your name as the author name, and add a description if you wish. The other settings can stay at the suggested default values. 

Add Express.js:

```bash
npm install express
```

Now, edit the project.

```bash
code .
```

Open the `server.js` file for editing. Make it do something. For example:

```js
console.log('Hello, world!');
```

Back in Terminal, run the app:

```bash
node server.js
```

It should respond with the console message, and then terminate.

### Write a simple web server 

Follow much of the technique used in BTI325 Week 9. Our goal is to create an app that will handle these requests:
* Get all
* Get one
* Add new
* Edit existing
* Delete item

This goal will work for a web service that handles ANY kind of data. Obviously, a more complex data model will have more request handlers, but they all share the same core design, and handle these five - or variants of these five - requests. 

> See the course's code repository for ready-to-use (and edit) templates. 

The core getting-started code looks something like the following. It assumes it is working with a "user" object that has a first name and a last name (as string data). 

```js
// Setup
const express = require("express");
const path = require("path");
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const app = express();
const HTTP_PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080;
// Or use some other port number that you like better

// Add support for incoming JSON entities
app.use(bodyParser.json());

// Deliver the app's home page to browser clients
app.get("/", (req,res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "/index.html"));
});

// Get all
app.get("/api/items", (req, res) => {
    res.json({ message: "fetch all items" });
});

// Get one
app.get("/api/items/:itemId", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: `get user with identifier: ${req.params.id}` });
});

// Add new
// This route expects a JSON object in the body, e.g. { "firstName": "Peter", "lastName": "McIntyre" }
app.post("/api/items", (req, res) => {
  // MUST return HTTP 201
  res.status(201).json({ message: `added a new item: ${req.body.firstName} ${req.body.lastName}` });
});

// Edit existing
// This route expects a JSON object in the body, e.g. { "id": 123, "firstName": "Peter", "lastName": "McIntyre" }
app.put("/api/items/:id", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: `updated item with identifier: ${req.params.id} to ${req.body.firstName} ${req.body.lastName}` });
});

// Delete item
app.delete("/api/items/:id", (req, res) => {
  // MUST return HTTP 204
  res.status(200).json({ "message": `deleted user with identifier: ${req.params.id}` });

  // In a real app, do not send body data, instead just send...
  //res.status(204).end();
});

// Resource not found (this should be at the end)
app.use((req, res) => {
  res.status(404).send("Resource not found");
});

// Tell the app to start listening for requests
app.listen(HTTP_PORT, () => {
    console.log("Ready to handle requests on port " + HTTP_PORT);
});
```

### More info about routes

[This document](web-api-route-design) has a summary of guidance about designing suitable routes in your web API and app. 

<br>

#### Edit `server.js` 

Edit `server.js` so that it holds the code shown above. 

<br>

#### Make a simple home page (HTML)

Edit `index.html`. Use the `html:5` Emmet snippet to help with this task. 

<br>

#### Run the app

In Terminal, run the app.

Open a browser, and navigate to the root (home page). 

Open Postman, and interact with the resources that begin with `/api/`. 

> [This document](/bti425/notes/postman-intro) introduces you to Postman, and has how-to getting started info.

<br>

### Add some data (simple arrays)

You obviously noticed that the server's functions were not really handling any data. The requests and responses were simple strings. We'll change that now, and use real data.

We have to do two tasks:
1. Add some data
2. Edit the functions

<br>

#### Add simple string data

Let's add a super-simple array of strings, for example the names of colours. Somewhere in the `server.js` file, create a variable to hold the data, something like this:

```js
// Array of strings
var colours = [ 'Red', 'Green', 'Blue', 'Yellow', 'Aqua', 'Fuschia' ];
```

Change the "get all" function, and this time return the data.

What about the other functions? Yes, they need some work. 

If we assume that `itemId` is the array element or index, then we can code a "get one". For example, the function body looks like the following:

```js
// Extract the item identifier
let itemId = req.params.itemId;
// Make sure it's valid 
if (itemId > colours.length) {
  res.status(404).send("Resource not found");
} else {
  res.json(colours[itemId]);
}
```

Next, if we assume that we pass in a simple JSON object with one key-value pair (and the key name is "colourName"), then we can code an "add new". For example, the function body looks like the following:

```js
// Extract the incoming data from { "colourName": "Purple" }
let newItem = req.body.colourName;
// Add another item to the array
colours.push(newItem);
// Return the result; RFC 7231 tells us that it must return HTTP status 201
res.status(201).json({ message: `added ${newItem} as item identifier ${colours.length}` });
```

<br>

### Add some data (objects)

We will leave this as an in-class hands-on task (in our computer-lab session). 

<br>

#### Generate a substantial amount of data

One of the new skills that a BTI425 student should add is the ability to generate and use a large amount of data. This is especially important for web programmers, because the result of the work we do is so visual in nature. It is always a good idea to use and show good solid credible data, instead of crappy placeholder data (e.g. abc, 123, foo, bar, etc.) that is so common in entry-level programming work. 

Here, we will introduce you to, or remind you about, the [Mockaroo service](https://mockaroo.com):

> Need some mock data to test your app?  
> Mockaroo lets you generate up to 1,000 rows of realistic test data in CSV, JSON, SQL, and Excel formats.

Problem solved. 

Generate some data. Make sure you configure enough fields to give you a rich variety of data. For the professor's in-class demonstration example, here are a few notable choices we made:
* Birth date was within a range and in ISO 8601 format 
* Credit score was an integer within a range
* Rating was a number within a range with two decimal places
* 150 rows were returned
* Data format was JSON

Here's a screen capture. (Right-click and then open it in a new tab/window to see it full size.)

<br>

#### Use the data in your web service

The data comes to your system as a standard download. Open it for editing. Copy it. 

In your code, similar to what you did above, assign the JSON as the value of a new variable.

```js
var people = // your pasted JSON goes here
```

Don't forget the statement's trailing semicolon. 

Now you have a rich body of data, with which you can do the standard get all, get one, add new, edit existing, and delete item tasks. 

<br>

#### Update the code in the functions

Obviously, the code in the functions needs updating, to work with the new data. 

**Get all** is easy to fix. 

If you want sorted data - for example by last name then first name - more work needs to be done. The built-in JavaScript array `sort()` function mutates the existing array. Maybe that's not such a good idea. Therefore, before sorting, copy the array to a new array, with something like this:

```js
var c = data.map(p => p);
```

Then, the "c" array can be mutated, with something like this:

```js
c.sort(function (a, b) {
    return a.lastName.localeCompare(b.lastName) ||
        a.firstName.localeCompare(b.firstName) || 0
});

// or, using arrow function syntax...
c.sort((a, b) => {
    return a.lastName.localeCompare(b.lastName) ||
        a.firstName.localeCompare(b.firstName) || 0
});
```

Finally, the sorted "c" array can be returned. 

> Do you want to sort an array of numbers?  
> The "compare" is an arithmetic subtraction compare.  
> Look at the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) for more, but briefly:  
> ```js
> let numbers = [4, 2, 5, 1, 3];  
> numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);  
> ```

> Or, if the numbers were in a *property* of an array of objects:  
> ```js
> // assume the array "c" of people/person objects  
> // and we want to sort on credit score
> c.sort((a, b) => a.creditScore - b.creditScore);  
> ```

**Get one** is also relatively easy to fix. 

Compared to the "colours" array above, where it was easy to "find" the value we wanted, this "people" array has *objects* as elements in the array. We want to support finding a matching identifier (i.e. the "id" field). 

This needs a function (an arrow function, specifically). For example:

```js
var o = data.find(p => p.id == itemId);
```

Then, if "o" is "undefined", return HTTP 404. Otherwise return the object "o". 

You can do **the others** on your own (i.e. add new, edit existing, delete item). Doing this will remind you of your work with JavaScript arrays, and enhance those skills. 

Looking for a more challenging task?

Try adding another function to handle a request for people with a high credit score (e.g. a `creditScore` value over 600). We can suggest the `filter()` function can help with that. 

Try adding another function to return only the full names of the people objects. We suggest the `map()` function can help with that. (Bonus, sort the results.)

Try adding another function that will enable a *find* by last name (case insensitive). 

Doing these additional tasks will prepare you for more interesting work with data and its transformations. 

Enjoy!
