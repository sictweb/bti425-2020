## BTI425 Week 5 Notes

The theme for the next week is to continue to develop our component-oriented web application development skills using React.  We will examine how we can organize our app by splitting up components into separate files and use HTML forms and Ajax to communicate with our back end Teams API.  

We will also learn about client-side **routing** and how we can use the [React-Router](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router) (react-router-dom) package to create a SPA (Single-Page Application).

Remember to frequently use the [learning resources](/bti425-2020/resources).
