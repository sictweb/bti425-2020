## BTI425 Week 4 Notes

> Friday, January 24 - classroom lecture  
> Tuesday, January 28 - Test 1 in the computer-lab 

The theme for the next two weeks is to continue to develop our component-oriented web app development skills using React.  We will examine how we can organize our app by splitting up components into separate files, use HTML Forms, and communicate with a back-end web service.

### Friday plan

*Friday, January 24* 

After last week's introduction to React and the component idea, we will go further. 

Now, we want to work with *many* components, in containment and replacement or navigation scenarios. We have seen the containment idea already, and to implement navigation, we will learn about *routing*. 

[React components](react-components)  

Along the way, we will iterate more on two topics, forms, and communicating with a web service. 

Before we do the routing topic, we want to study two code examples, and learn the component concepts that they implement.  
* The first code example (`react-app-layout`) shows how a typical viewport is organized, when composed with a number of sequentially-presented components.  
* The second code example (`react-tania-updated`) is (as its name suggests) an updated version of last week's Tania Rascia code example. It has a more clearly-defined and obvious component structure, using containment (aka nesting or embedding). 

[Routing](react-routing) introduction, using the React Router package.  
* Open the `react-router-intro` code example as you go through the document. 

[Communicating with a web service](react-web-service-intro), with the Fetch API.  
* Open the `react-ws-intro` code example as you go through the document. 

An introduction to (or reminder about) the [Fetch API is in this document](fetch-intro). 

We will also have a very light touch today on using [HTML Forms](react-forms-intro) in React apps. 

> Full coverage of "Forms" in React apps is in [Week 5](week05)

Remember to frequently use the [learning resources](/bti425/resources).

### Code examples

The course's GitHub repo has code examples for many topics and techniques. You can download a zip of the code repo, or clone it. 
* React app layout, typical 
* Tania, updated component organization 
* Router introduction
* Using a web API in a React app

### Tuesday plan

*Tuesday, January 28* 

Test 1 is on Tuesday, January 28, 2020, and up to 80 minutes have been alotted for the test. At the beginning of the class time, the professor will be available to answer questions about course content, and then we will begin the test. 

[This document](test-success-info) has more information about the test.

There are three sections of the BTI425 course. All sections have Test 1 on the same day. The test will be different for each section. You are *EXPECTED* to behave with academic integrity - *DO NOT* communicate, in any way, with another BTI425 student about the content of the test.
