## BTI425 Week 4 Notes

The theme for the next two weeks is to continue to develop our component-oriented web app development skills using React.  We will examine how we can organize our app by splitting up components into separate files, use HTML Forms, and communicate with a back-end web service.

### Test info

Test 1 is on Monday, January 28, 2019. 

All tests in this course are hand-written, in pen or pencil. Answer styles will vary, but we're mostly looking for short- to medium-length answers, and/or diagrams, and so on.

No references or resources are permitted - "closed book, open brain". Device usage is not permitted. 

The duration of each test will be approximately 80 to 90 minutes. Generally, about 4 minutes per question is allotted, which seems to work out OK. And, you will have some choice - you will be able to answer any "x" of "y" questions.

The tested topics are mostly review-based, but will also include forward-looking topics for the current "week".  The forward-looking aspect encourages you to prepare for class, by reading and using the weekly content before the class. You will be tested on comprehension, understanding, and the application of new topics. The review-based aspect enables you to show that you have the foundational knowledge and understanding needed for current and future tasks.

A few other points:

* This is NOT a memorization course. This IS a learn and apply course. Simply reading, memorizing, and regurgitating words is not enough to convince anyone that you're competent. 

* You must apply the learning - by writing software - to convince others. 

* What content and activity do you have to cover while preparing for a test? Everything, and more. If you think that simply reading/scanning the few hundred words on these weekly notes pages is enough, you're doomed. You must think, analyze, and evaluate all topic content. 

  * Follow the links, and look up other referred-to topics. 

  * Look up and learn related topics that interest you and spark your curiosity. 

  * Go back to review/refresh topics covered in previous courses. 

  * Write code, study the code examples, and reproduce tutorial and code examples. 

  * Make some mistakes, find the solutions, and learn from the experience. 

  * If or when you need an answer to or explanation for something, ask your professor, or a fellow student who knows the answer.

### Topics this week

After last week's introduction to React and the component idea, we want to go further. 

Now, we want to work with *many* components, in containment and replacement or navigation scenarios. We have seen the containment idea already, and to implement navigation, we will learn about *routing*. 

Along the way, we will iterate more on two topics, forms, and communicating with a web service. 

Before we do the routing topic, we want to study two code examples, and learn the component concepts that they implement.  
[React components](react-components)  
The first code example (`react-app-layout`) shows how a typical viewport is organized, when composed with a number of sequentially-presented components.  
The second code example (`react-tania-updated`) is (as its name suggests) an updated version of last week's Tania Rascia code example. It has a more clearly-defined and obvious component structure, using containment (aka nesting or embedding). 

[Routing](react-routing) introduction, using the React Router package.  
Open the `react-router-intro` code example as you go through the document. 

[Communicating with a web service](react-web-service-intro), with the Fetch API.  
Open the `react-ws-intro` code example as you go through the document. 

> Coverage of "Forms" in React apps is moved to [Week 5](week5)

Remember to frequently use the [learning resources](/resources).
