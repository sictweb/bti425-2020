## BTI425 Week 5 Notes

> Friday, January 31 - classroom lecture  
> Tuesday, February 4 - hands-on in the computer-lab 

The theme for this week is to continue to develop our component-oriented web app development skills using React.  This week, we focus on using *HTML Forms*, and integrating all topics covered in a React app.

### Friday plan

*Friday, January 31* 

There are "patterns" that should be followed when creating an interactive web app. While you probably have had some coverage in the past, the following document collects the patterns into one summary document, which can be used as best-practice guidance.  
[HTML Form patterns](html-form-patterns)

While the advice in the previous document is general-purpose, and can be used on any kind of web app, there are some React-specific concepts and techniques that must be learned and implemented.  
[Forms in React apps](react-forms-intro)

When you're ready, you can deploy a React app to Heroku, so that it is on the public web. Then you can get the app on any device (computer, smartphone), and show others your work.  
[Deploy React app to Heroku](react-heroku-deploy)

During development, you can use debugging and inspection tools.

Remember to frequently use the [learning resources](/resources).

### Code examples

The course's GitHub repo has code examples for many topics and techniques. You can download a zip of the code repo, or clone it. 
* Form template code, React, using Bootstrap v3

### Tuesday plan

*Tuesday, February 4, 2020* 

The recent Test 1 will be returned to students. We will also review many of the example answers. 

Then, there will be time to work on the current programming assignment, and get help from the professor if you need or want help.
