## BTI425 Week 6 Notes

The theme for the *remainder of the course* is to cover the Angular platform.  

This week, it's all about *getting started with Angular*. Then, beginning next week, we'll do a weekly deep dive into these important app dev topic areas:
1. Components
2. Routing
3. Services
4. Forms

After that, we'll put together some apps. 

Remember to frequently use the [learning resources](/bti425/resources).

### Topics

A number of them today:
* History
* Orientation
* Big ideas
* Roadmap

Then, technical getting started topics:
* Install
* Edit cycle
* TypeScript
* Architecture
* Components

The recent coverage of React introduced you to a new way to think about building a client-side web app. Now, we do it again in Angular.  

To get started, read this [introduction to Angular](angular-intro), and also follow its links to read or skim additional content.

Next, follow along as you [get started with Angular](angular-get-started). Learn how to install the developer bits, and generate a starter app. Then, start learning about its architecture. Follow the tutorials. 

Then, we repeat or highlight some of [the important topics and concepts](angular-architecture) from the getting started guide and tutorials.

#### Code examples

We have two code examples today:
1. Animals - an Angular version of the multi-component React code example from week 4 
2. Customers - the end result of the in-class demonstration

The first in-depth topic set that we will study is *components*. Let's get started now with this topic:

[Angular Components Introduction](angular-components-intro): This document discusses Components in detail, including how to get started using components / creating components from scratch, using "templates" in components, and writing attribute/structural directives.

[Angular Components Example](angular-components-example): This document guides us through a simple example ("animals"), where we plan a view with multiple components from scratch. Then, download and study its code example from the GitHub repo.

In class this week, the professor will demonstrate a project that shows a particular strength of Angular - easy and robust updates in the user interface. [Follow along in the notes](angular-components-inclass), and try to build it yourself. Then, download and study its code example from the GitHub repo.

In the computer-lab class, the professor will [introduce *simple* routing](angular-routing-intro) for an Angular app. Then, each student will get some experience creating an app by completing a non-graded [hands-on exercise](week06-hands-on).
