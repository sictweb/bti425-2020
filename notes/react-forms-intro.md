## React and HTML Forms introduction

The React documentation about HTML Forms is [located here](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html).  

Read through it now, before continuing below. 

Yes, really - read the docs. Now. 

Welcome back. 

> Also.. general HTML Forms reference info:  
> Review the docs about [HTML forms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms) and [native form widgets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/The_native_form_widgets). 

<br>

### Useful concepts and topics, and their implementation

A big difference, when compared to HTML Forms in "plain" HTML5 apps, is the concept of *binding*. 

With React (and Angular) apps, we typically *bind* a form element to the component for two reasons:
1. Behaviour (event binding) - one or more functions that handle events that happen in the form element (e.g. change, blur)

2. State (data binding) - a property in component state to hold the current value or contents of the form element

Another difference comes out of the first big difference. In summary, we typically do not use a `<form>` element. This kind of element provides an extra feature that may not be all that useful or important in a React app that uses binding, so we don't have to include it. 

> In case you're curious...  
> The extra feature is *"enter" key handling while the keyboard input focus* (i.e. the cursor) is in a text input field. In this scenario, pressing "enter" will "submit" the form. Think about this for a moment, and you will also see how that's probably not all that useful or important.  
> See [this SO note](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41205384/is-the-use-of-the-form-tag-necessary-in-reactjs-that-have-hoc-input-tags-that), and [this opinion](https://hashnode.com/post/why-do-you-write-eventpreventdefault-in-react-cjdznf1el0atom3wt831c2m9o). 

> If you really want this enter>submit behaviour, your code must change:  
> The opening form tag is `<form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>`.  
> Change the "submit" `<button>` to an `<input type='submit'`.  
> Must always call `e.preventDefault()` in the "submit" event handler.

### Visualization, a form in React

The following is a minimally-edited `App.js` that has an `input` form element and an element that simply displays the content entered in the `input` form element. 

The code with the <span style='background-color: cyan'>blue</span> highlight (background) is for Bootstrap 3 to do its job. 

The code with the <span style='background-color: yellow'>yellow</span> highlight is the class' state property. 

The code with the <span style='background-color: lime'>green</span> highlight is the class' state property.

### Summary of guidance

Write a general-purpose `handleChange` function, and then write code for each form element (or code that will work for all form elements).

Write a `handleSubmit` function, to handle a "submit" `<button>`. 

In the constructor:
* Bind the two functions (above) to `this`. 
* Create state properties to hold the form element data.

In the markup of each form element, add the `handleChange` handler.

### Other interesting things

Here are a few other interesting things done while preparing this week's topic coverage. 

<br>

#### Want a document title (for the tab)?

In a component's `render()` method, set the document title:  
```js
document.title ='whatever';
```

<br>

#### How to "redirect" reminder

First, import the React Router `withRouter` component.

```js
import { Link, withRouter } from "react-router-dom";
```

Then, modify the component class export statement.

```js
export default withRouter(ClassComponentName);
```

Finally, use this code to do a redirect.

```js
// Redirect (assuming result.id is a value)
this.props.history.push(`/users/detail/${result.id}`);
```

<br>

#### How to "go back" (navigate back)

Do the first two things above. 

The third thing is one of these statements:

```js
// Redirect 
this.props.history.goBack());
// equivalent to...
this.props.history.go(-1));
```
