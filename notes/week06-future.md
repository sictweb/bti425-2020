## BTI425 Week 6 Notes

The theme for the *remainder of the course* is to cover the Angular platform.  

This week, it's all about *getting started with Angular*. Then, beginning next week, we'll do a weekly deep dive into these important app dev topic areas:
1. Components
2. Routing
3. Services
4. Forms

After that, we'll put together a number of apps. 

Remember to frequently use the [learning resources](/web422/resources).

**Topics:**

A number of them:
* History
* Orientation
* Big ideas
* Roadmap

Getting started:
* Install
* Edit cycle
* TypeScript
* Architecture
* Components

The recent coverage of React introduced you to a new way to think about building a client-side web app. Now, we do it again in Angular.  

To get started, read this [introduction to Angular](angular-intro), and also follow its links to read or skim additional content.

Next, follow along as you [get started with Angular](angular-get-started). Learn how to install the developer bits, and generate a starter app. Then, start learning about its architecture. Follow the tutorials. 

Then, we repeat or highlight some of [the important topics and concepts](angular-architecture) from the getting started guide and tutorials.

The first in-depth topic set that we will study is *components*. Let's get started now with this topic:

[Angular Components Introduction](angular-components-intro): This document discusses Components in detail, including how to get started using components / creating components from scratch, using "templates" in components, and writing attribute/structural directives.

[Angular Components Example](angular-components-example): This document guides us through a simple example ("animals"), where we plan a view with multiple components from scratch.

In class on Tuesday, February 20, the professor started working with a project that shows a particular strength of Angular - easy and robust updates in the user interface. [Follow along in the notes](angular-components-inclass), and try to build it yourself. Then, download and study its code example from the GitHub repo.
