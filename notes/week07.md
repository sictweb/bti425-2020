## BTI425 Week 7 Notes

Remember, the theme for the *remainder of the course* is to cover the Angular platform.  

Last week, we learned the essential topics to get started with Angular. A hands-on exercise enabled you to become familiar with components, and to transition another topic, routing.

### This week's plan

As you know, Monday is our classroom "lecture" day. The Family Day holiday is Monday, February 18, which means that we miss that in-class session. 

As a result, you will have a bit more self-study and self-directed work to do this week than is usual. 

If you have not yet done so, make sure you successfully complete last week's non-graded "[hands on](https://bti425.ca/notes/week06-hands-on)" exercise. 

In this week's computer-lab in-class session, your professor will present highlights of another topic set, and then help you get started on this week's non-graded "[hands on](https://bti425.ca/notes/week07-hands-on)" exercise, which enables you to get some more practice.
