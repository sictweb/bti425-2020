## BTI425 Week 7 Notes

> Friday, February 14 - classroom lecture  
> Tuesday, February 18 - hands-on in the computer-lab 

This week, we will learn and experience the Angular app-building process. The first in-depth topic coverage will be about *components*. 

<br>

### Friday plan

*Friday, February 14* 

The first in-depth topic set that we will study is *components*. Let's get started now with this topic:

[Angular Components Introduction](angular-components-intro): This document discusses Components in detail, including how to get started using components / creating components from scratch, using "templates" in components, and writing attribute/structural directives.

[Angular Components Example](angular-components-example): This document guides us through a simple example ("animals"), where we plan a view with multiple components from scratch. Then, download and study its code example from the GitHub repo.

In class this week, the professor will demonstrate a project that shows a particular strength of Angular - easy and robust updates in the user interface. [Follow along in the notes](angular-components-inclass), and try to build it yourself. Then, download and study its code example from the GitHub repo.

[Angular component interaction](angular-components-interaction) describes how to do containment, and pass values from "parent" to "child".

Remember to frequently use the [learning resources](/bti425-2020/resources).

### Code examples

This week's code examples:
1. Animals - an Angular version of the multi-component React "router introduction" code example from week 4 
2. Customers - the end result of the in-class demonstration 
3. Interaction - passing data to an embedded component

### Tuesday plan

*Tuesday, February 18* 

We will do an [in-class task](week07-in-class), in which you will learn through hands-on experience.
