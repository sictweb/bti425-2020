## BTI425 Week 6 Notes

> Friday, February 7 - classroom lecture  
> Tuesday, February 11 - hands-on in the computer-lab 

The theme for the *remainder of the course* is to cover the Angular platform.  

This week, it's all about *getting started with Angular*. Then, beginning next week, we'll do a weekly deep dive into these important Angular topic areas:
1. Components
2. Routing
3. Services
4. Forms

<br>

### Friday plan

*Friday, February 7* 

A number of getting started topics today:
* History
* Orientation
* Big ideas
* Roadmap

Then, some technical coverage:
* Install
* Edit-run cycle
* TypeScript
* Architecture
* Components

The recent coverage of React introduced you to a new way to think about building a client-side web app. Now, we do it again in Angular.  

To get started, read this [introduction to Angular](angular-intro), and also follow its links to read or skim additional content.

Next, follow along as you [get started with Angular](angular-get-started). Learn how to install the developer bits, and generate a starter app. Then, start learning about its architecture. Follow the tutorials. 

In class (on Friday), we'll do a hands-on example [that is documented](angular-intro-inclass) - re-create this on your own. 

Then, we repeat or highlight some of [the important topics and concepts](angular-architecture) from the getting started guide and tutorials. 

Remember to frequently use the [learning resources](/bti425-2020/resources).

### Code examples

The course's GitHub repo has code examples for many topics and techniques. You can download a zip of the code repo, or clone it. 

We have code examples today:
1. Friday - a new simple Angular app 
2. In-class - the end result of the hands-on in-class exercise

<br>

### Tuesday plan

*Tuesday, February 11* 

We will do an [in-class task](week06-in-class), in which you will create a new Angular app, and learn through hands-on experience.
