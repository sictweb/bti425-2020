### Introduction

This week, we have example *web API* apps. All are Node.js + Express.js apps. None have a database, but some use an in-memory array to hold the app's data items. 

<br>

### Web API version 4

No database, no data - just string responses from the Express.js methods. 

<br>

### Web API version 5

No database, and the data (a collection of strings) is in memory.  
Methods that support get all, get one, add new, edit existing, and delete item.  

<br>

### Web API version 6

No database, and the data (a collection of automobile objects) is in memory.  
Methods that support get all, get one, add new, edit existing, and delete item.  
This app uses a data model manager (<code>manager.js</code>) to handle data service tasks.
