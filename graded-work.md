## Graded work

This page has details about the graded work in BTI425, for the current Winter 2020 academic term.

<br>

### Tests

We have planned three (3) tests during the term.

Test | Theme | Value | Date
--- | --- | --- | ---
Test 1 | Web service and React topics | 15% | January 28 
Test 2 | Angular topics (up to Routing) | 15% | March 3 
Test 3 | Angular topics (up to Security) | 20% | March 31

The duration of each test will be approximately 90 minutes. All tests will be hand-written, with no references or resources allowed. The total value of all tests will be 50% of the final course grade.

Recognizing that it's possible to have an "off day", the final grade calculation will examine the results of all tests, and discount the value or weighting of the lowest-graded test to 50%.

Is there a "missed test policy"? Yes; here it is:

The policy is very limited. It is designed to recognize a single *legitimate* illness or medical issue that a severely and negatively affects academic performance during the date-and-time of the test. 

If an illness or medical issue causes a student to miss a test, and wants the professor to consider a remedy, then the student must follow this procedure:
1. Notify the professor by email, before the test date-and-time, of the absence.
2. Within 48 hours of the test date-and-time, obtain a diagnosis from a medical doctor (licensed for practice in Ontario), and obtain documentation that clearly states that your academic performance was affected during the test date-and-time. 
3. Send a digital version of the documentation (e.g. a photo or a scan) to the professor, and deliver the original (paper) documentation at the earliest convenient opportunity. 
4. Do NOT communicate, in any way, with another registered BTI425 student about the contents of the test. 

The professor will then consider your request for a remedy. If granted, the specifics of the remedy will be arranged, and will be customized to the situation. (For example, the remedy may be that the student writes the test within 72 hours of its original date-and-time. However, it is possible that there will be a different remedy.)

### Assignments

We have planned three (3) assignments during the term. The total value of all assignments will be 50% of the final course grade. 

Assignment | Theme | Value | Released | Due Date
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Assign 1 | React app | 15% | January 14 | February 4 at 11:00pm 
Assign 2 | Angular app,<br>including the Forms topic | 25% | February 18 | March 24 at 11:00pm 
Assign 3 | Angular app,<br>add security features | 10% | March 24 | April 7 at 11:00pm

(Each app will also require a web service.)

Is there a "late policy"? Yes; here it is:

Each assignment can be up to two (2) days (or 48 hours) late. In other words: 
* Each assignment is due on a Tuesday at 11:00pm 
* A late submission will be accepted up to the Thursday at 11:00pm 

There will be a small grade penalty for a late assignment. The professor will determine a grade for your work, and then multiply the grade by 0.9 to yield a result that will be recorded in the Blackboard grade center. 

If an assignment is more than two (2) days late, it will be graded as zero. 

If your assignment is not complete (for example, it's missing some features), you can still submit a partially-completed assignment by the due date, and earn part marks. 

<br>

### Promotion Policy

* Achieve an average of 50% or better for all assignments
*	Achieve an average of 50% or better for all tests
*	Achieve a weighted average of 50% or better for all graded work in the course

<br>

### Summary

Tests - 3 in total - 50%  
Assignments - 3 in total - 50%  

This course does NOT have a final exam. 

If you do not agree with this graded work plan, then please drop the course.

### Frequently-asked questions

The following are frequently-asked questions about course policies and grading. 

<br>

**Make-up (replacement) tests? No.**

We don't do make-up or replacement tests, for a number of reasons, including the following:

* To reduce the negative effect of a poorly-done test, the final grade calculation will discount the value or weighting of the lowest-graded test to 50%.

* Test answers are discussed during or soon after the test date-and-time, so doing a test after class is pointless.

Therefore, no make-up or replacement tests. 

<br>

**Due date extensions? No.**

As noted above, each assignment can be up to two (2) days late, and will incur a small grade penalty. 

However, as a general rule, we don't do due date extensions for assignments, for a number of reasons, including the following:

* A due date extension is not necessary in this course, because each assignment is designed so that it can comfortably and successfully completed - by *all* students - before its due date and time.

* It causes problems for other work that follows an assignment, because it leaves less time to complete the next piece of work.

* It takes your attention away from new topics in this course. You're less receptive, or will ignore, new topics that follow those that are practiced on the assignment.

* A due date extension is disrespectful to other students in the course, because it tells them that the work they did to meet the due date doesn't have value.

* Finally, a due date extension is disrespectful to other professors and their courses, because it takes your attention away from their coursework while you are working on late work in another course.

Therefore, no due date extensions.
