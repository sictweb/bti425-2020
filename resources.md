<br>

### Developer tools

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (info, download)  
   * [Getting started docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)
* Browsers (current versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, Edge)  
* Browser dev tools

* Other dev tools will be introduced as we make progress through the weekly topics

You will need one or more devices. A College or personal desktop or laptop, and (likely) a personal mobile device (e.g. a smartphone).

[This document](/bti425/notes/postman-intro) introduces you to Postman, and has how-to getting started info.

<br>

**Use macOS or Linux**

We expect the student to do their work on a computer that runs macOS (Mac OS X), Linux, or another Unix-like operating system. 

If a student has a Windows 10 computer, then plan to install one of the following: 
* a multiboot or virtualization environment that enables the installation of Linux 
* Windows Subsystem for Linux, and one of the distros from the Microsoft Store

<br>

### Required textbook

None. This is a web programming course therefore, the best source for content is on the web!

<br>

### Required online resources

There are several required online resources:

* The Mozilla Developer Network **MDN Web Docs** web site is vast, with thousands of documents. It is a trusted and authoritative source for web developer information. Of interest:

* [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML) Guide, including [HTML Forms Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms), and the [HTML5 Element List](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list)

* [CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

* JavaScript Reference
  * [JavaScript Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
  * (Also suggested) [You Don't Know JavaScript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)

* [DOM Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM)

> In October 2017, Microsoft, Google, and the W3C committed to making *MDN Web Docs* the single authoritative source for web developer documentation.  
> Read more about this in an [article by Ali Spivak](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/10/18/mozilla-brings-microsoft-google-w3c-samsung-together-create-cross-browser-documentation-mdn/). 

**Others:**

* [Bootstrap (version 3) CSS documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/)  
Links to other topics (e.g. Getting started, etc.) are on that page

* Third-party (formden) [Guide: Bootstrap Forms by Example](https://formden.com/bootstrap-form-guide/)

* Official [Angular Documentation](https://angular.io/docs)

* Angular CLI videos on YouTube, by [Codevolution](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC80PWRj_ZU8Zu0HSMNVwKWw/videos)

* Node Reference
  * [Node.js Documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/)
  * (Suggested) [nodejitsu](https://docs.nodejitsu.com/)

* [Express.js Documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html)

* [TypesScript Reference](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html)

<br>

Oh, and you should must know (and love!) the series of RFCs that describe HTTP, [7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230) through 7235. If you want a friendlier introduction to [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol), read its Wikipedia article.

### Visual Studio Code tips and info

**Start VS Code from the command line**

Make sure that you're in your project folder.  
Then type this command: `code .`

> Note: This assumes that your computer is configured to run this command. See the [Running VS Code on Mac](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac) to configure that feature. 

<br>

**Useful keyboard shortcuts (macOS)**

Task | Keyboard shortcut
--- | ---
Trigger IntelliSense | `Control + Space` 
Toggle comments on/off | `Command + /`
Reformat document| `Shift + Option + Command + F`
Show/hide left-side bar| `Command + B`
Show/hide terminal| `Control + (back-tick)`
Markdown preview pane toggle on/off| `Command + K, V`

A full list of keyboard shortcuts in a nice printable format is here:
* For [macOS](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf) 
* For [Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf) 
* For [Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf) 

<br>

**Useful Emmet snippets for HTML**

For most elements, just begin typing the element name, without the angle bracket.

Emmet snippet | Task
--- | ---
`.` | Declare class(es), e.g. `div.row`
`#` | Declare unique identifier, e.g. `table#customers`
`>` | Child, e.g. `div>p`
`*` | Multiplier, e.g. `ul>li*5`
`( )` |Grouping, often used with multiplier
`+` |Sibling, e.g. `div>h3+p*3`
`{blahblah}` | Text content for an element, e.g. `h3{Hello, world!}`
`[` |Custom attribute, e.g. `span[data-bind`

See the [Emmet cheat sheet](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/) for full coverage.

### Other tooling tips

#### npm 

What version of an npm package is installed?

```bash
# All globally-installed packages
npm list -g

# One specific globally-installed package
npm list -g express

# While in the root of a project, one specfic package
npm list express
```

<br>

#### Heroku and its CLI

Heroku Dev Center, documentation:  
[Heroku CLI Usage](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-the-cli)

If you attempt to do this:  
`git push heroku master`  
...and it generates an error, then verify that your project knows its remote destination (i.e. its hosting Heroku app):  
`git remote -v`  
If it does know its remote destination, then you can set/fix it. [As described and shown here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#creating-a-heroku-remote), this command will set the remote to an existing Heroku app named "foo-bar-app":  
`heroku git:remote -a foo-bar-app`

<br>

#### MongoDB

Various commands:

```bash
# Is the database engine installed?
mongod --version

# Is the command shell installed?
mongo --version

# Start the database engine
mongod --dbpath [path-to-database-folder]
```
